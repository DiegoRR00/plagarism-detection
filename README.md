# plagarism-detection
This project's goal was to implement an optimal allignment based plagarism detection algorithm. This project was developed as part of the INF-4202B - Applied Algorithms: Strings and Images Course I took in ESIEE-Paris
The instructions followed to implement this algorithm can be found in: https://perso.esiee.fr/~coustyj/Sequences/IT-4301E-TDm2.html
